# Database Schema Synchronization - Payment Revert Feature

## Summary

The payment revert feature has been fully implemented with all necessary database schema changes. This document outlines the changes made and ensures the server/production database is synchronized with the local development environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update

**File:** `/database/schema/database-schema.sql`

Updated the `payments` table to include:
- `invoice_number` VARCHAR(20) - Unique invoice tracking
- `reverted` TINYINT(1) - Flag indicating if payment is reverted (default: 0)
- `reverted_date` TIMESTAMP - When the payment was reverted
- `reverted_reason` VARCHAR(255) - Reason for reversal

**Indexes Added:**
- `idx_payments_invoice_number` - For invoice number lookups
- `idx_payments_reverted` - For revert status queries
- `idx_payments_reverted_date` - For revert date range queries

### 2. Migration File Created

**File:** `/database/migrations/add-reverted-columns-migration.sql`

This migration script should be run on the server/production database to add the reverted columns to existing `payments` tables.

**Migration Steps:**
```sql
-- These will be executed:
1. ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN reverted TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0;
2. ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN reverted_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
3. ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN reverted_reason VARCHAR(255);
4. CREATE INDEX idx_payments_reverted ON payments(reverted);
5. CREATE INDEX idx_payments_reverted_date ON payments(reverted_date);
```

**Migration Impact:**
- ✅ Safe operation (no data loss)
- ✅ Non-blocking (small alter operations)
- ✅ Backward compatible (new columns default to NULL/0)
- ✅ All existing payments default to `reverted = 0` (not reverted)

### 3. Current Local Database Status

Local database (`emsd_system`) has been verified to contain:
- `reverted` column (TINYINT(1), DEFAULT 0)
- `reverted_date` column (TIMESTAMP NULL)
- `reverted_reason` column (VARCHAR(255))
- All required indexes

## Deployment Checklist

Before pushing to production:

- [ ] Verify server/production database exists and is accessible
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Run migration script: `/database/migrations/add-reverted-columns-migration.sql`
- [ ] Verify migration completed successfully:
  ```sql
  DESCRIBE payments;  -- Check columns exist
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE reverted = 1;  -- Should be 0 initially
  ```
- [ ] Push code changes to repository
- [ ] Deploy backend to production (Railway)
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work with production database

## Migration for Production (Railway MySQL)

To apply this migration to the production database on Railway:

1. **Access Railway MySQL Console**
   - Log into Railway dashboard
   - Navigate to your MySQL service
   - Open MySQL terminal/console

2. **Run Migration Script**
   ```bash
   # Copy and paste the migration script into the console
   # OR use command line:
   mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p <password> emsd_system < add-reverted-columns-migration.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Migration**
   ```sql
   SELECT 'Payments table structure after migration:' as status;
   DESCRIBE payments;
   ```

## Files Modified

1. **`/database/schema/database-schema.sql`**
   - Updated `CREATE TABLE payments` statement
   - Added 4 new columns and 3 indexes

2. **`/database/migrations/add-reverted-columns-migration.sql`** (NEW)
   - Migration script for existing databases
   - Safe ALTER statements with verification queries

## Verification Commands

After running migrations, verify everything is in sync:

```sql
-- Check payments table structure
DESCRIBE payments;

-- Check for reverted payments (should be 0 initially)
SELECT COUNT(*) as reverted_count FROM payments WHERE reverted = 1;

-- Check index exists
SHOW INDEX FROM payments WHERE Key_name LIKE 'idx_payments%';

-- Sample data
SELECT id, student_id, total_amount, reverted, reverted_reason 
FROM payments 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**
- All new columns have defaults (NULL or 0)
- Existing payment data is not modified
- Queries not using reverted columns continue to work
- Frontend gracefully handles missing reverted field

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, test:

- [ ] Create new payment - should default to `reverted = 0`
- [ ] Revert payment - should set `reverted = 1` and populate dates/reasons
- [ ] Query payment history - should filter out reverted correctly
- [ ] Dashboard stats - should exclude reverted payments
- [ ] Charges breakdown - should exclude reverted from totals
- [ ] Assessment module - should exclude reverted from calculations

## Rollback Plan

If needed to rollback (not recommended unless migration failed):

```sql
ALTER TABLE payments DROP COLUMN reverted;
ALTER TABLE payments DROP COLUMN reverted_date;
ALTER TABLE payments DROP COLUMN reverted_reason;
DROP INDEX idx_payments_reverted ON payments;
DROP INDEX idx_payments_reverted_date ON payments;
```

⚠️ **Note:** Only rollback if migration failed. Otherwise, keep new columns (they're safe even if unused).

## Summary

✅ Local database is fully synchronized with schema changes
✅ Migration script created for production database
✅ All changes are backward compatible
✅ Safe to push code changes after running migration on production

**Next Steps:**
1. Run migration on production database (Railway)
2. Verify migration success
3. Push code changes to repository
4. Deploy backend to production
5. Test payment revert functionality in production
